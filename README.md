Interview task. Objective is to make a game of simulation genre, in the style of "the sims" and "stardew valley". Steps below.

\n Assuming the game is of the simulation genre, similar to that of ‘The Sims’ and ‘Stardew Valley’, please create a functional clothes shop with all of the features you imagine would be required. It should be a top-down view like Stardew Valley and not a sidescroller, platformer, or birds-eye view. There should be a player character that is able to walk and interact with the game world. Features required: Talking to the shopkeeper, buying/selling items, item icons, item prices as well as equipping the bought outfits. The outfits that are equipped should be visible on the character itself. You may choose your own UI that you believe is suitable for this prototype. You can use pre-made art assets or create your own for this task. If you are using pre-written code from other projects please specify which they are. This is very important as we would like to know which is written during the time of the interview. The game should be able to run as a direct executable file and should be uploaded to Github. This ensures that we can easily play the game to playtest. Please write up 300-word documentation to explain exactly how the system works, your thought process during the interview as well as your own opinion on how well you think you did. Please attach it as a PDF file to the github.
