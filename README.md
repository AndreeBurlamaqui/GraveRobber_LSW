Create a functional clothes shop with all of the features you imagine would be required.

It should be a top-down view like Stardew Valley and not a sidescroller, platformer, or birds-eye view.

There should be a player character that is able to walk and interact with the game world.

Features required: Talking to the shopkeeper, buying/selling items, item icons, item prices as well as equipping the bought outfits. The outfits that are equipped should be visible on the character itself.
